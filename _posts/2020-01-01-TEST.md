This is a math test: $n$ and $n^2$.

$$ E = m c^2 $$

n^2^

n<sup>2</sup>


First of all, let us consider several examples to show how well *ChatGPT* can handle deductive reasoning in some fairly complex settings. In Example 1, we show that *ChatGPT* can correctly answer a complex factual question, which requires at least two reasoning steps: i) figure out all relevant countries; ii) infer the capitals of these countries.

In Example 2, we show that *ChatGPT* can sucessefully handle a complex scheduling task. It has shown that *ChatGPT* can fully understand all conditions given in the question. First, it can infer what the subway schedule looks like, and then do simple math to calculate the closest subway to catch the meeting.

In Example 3, we show that *ChatGPT* can use strong logical reasoning to track a fairly complex scenario, which requires several math calculations as well as what each given number exactly means.
